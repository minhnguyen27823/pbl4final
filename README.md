We have also released the Emotion-Gait dataset with this code, which is available for download here: [https://go.umd.edu/emotion-gait](https://go.umd.edu/emotion-gait).

1. `generator_cvae` is the generator.
2. `classifier_stgcn_real_only` is the baseline classifier using only the real 342 gaits.
3. `classifier_stgcn_real_and_synth` is the baseline classifier using both real 342 and N synthetic gaits.
4. `clasifier_hybrid` is the hybrid classifier using both deep and physiologically-motivated features.
5. `compute_aff_features` consists of the set of scripts to compute the affective features from 16-joint pose sequences. Calling `main.py` with the correct data path computes the features, and save them in the `affectiveFeatures<f_type>.h5` file, where `f_type` is the desired type of features:

	* `''` original data (default)
	* `4DCVAEGCN` data generated by the CVAE.
